# Home-asset-inventory
Classify the assets connected to a home network

### Overview
In this activity, you will classify assets connected to a home office network.

Asset management is a critical part of every organization's security plan. Remember that asset management is the process of tracking assets and the risks that affect them. Effective asset management starts with creating an asset inventory, or a catalog of assets that need to be protected. Then, it involves classifying assets based on their level of importance and sensitivity to risk.

### Scenario
One of the most valuable assets in the world today is information. Most information is accessed over a network. There tend to be a variety of devices connected to a network and each is a potential entry point to other assets.

An inventory of network devices can be a useful asset management tool. An inventory can highlight sensitive assets that require extra protection.

A home office that includes a desktop computer, printer, router, webcam, speakers, headphones, and external hard drive.
You’re operating a small business from your home and must create an inventory of your network devices. This will help you determine which ones contain sensitive information that require extra protection.

To do this, you will start by identifying three devices that have access to your home network. This might include devices such as:

  * Desktop or laptop computers
  * Smartphones
  * Smart home devices
  * Game consoles
  * Storage devices or servers
  * Video streaming devices

Then, you’ll list important characteristics of each device such as its owner, location, and type. Finally, you will assign each device a level of sensitivity based on how important it is to protect.

### Step 2: Identify assets
In the asset inventory spreadsheet, find the Asset column header. Consider the devices that may be connected to the home network. Examine devices in the scenario graphic to help you brainstorm.

Choose three devices that are not already listed in the spreadsheet and add them to the empty rows in the Asset column.

### Step 3: Fill in the characteristics of each asset
List important characteristics, including Network access, Owner, and Location for each asset that you’ve identified.

Here’s an explanation of each characteristic: 
  * **Network access** describes how often the device is connected to the network.
  * **Owner** describes the person responsible for the device.
  * **Location** describes where the device is located in relation to the router.

### Step 4: Evaluate the access of network devices 
Review the information that you’ve listed in the Network access, Owner, and Location columns.

In the Notes column, record 1 or 2 details or characteristics of each device. Do this by asking yourself questions about each:
  * What kind of information is stored on the device?
  * How does it connect to the network?
  * Is the owner careful about securing it?

For example, the desktop computer contains sensitive information, like photos, that only the owner should have access to. In contrast, the network router uses one frequency for smart home devices and another for all other devices.
